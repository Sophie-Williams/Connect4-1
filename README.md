## Description
A Two-Player Game designed using the MiniMax Algorithm alongwith alpha-beta pruning. It Contains three difficulty levels which are nothing but the maximum depth allowed for the maximiser to evaluate. Although the algorithm performs considerably well, it is not impossible to beat it and an algorithm designed with better heuristics will beat it easily. To overcome this problem, a version making use of Zobrist hashing will soon be released.
